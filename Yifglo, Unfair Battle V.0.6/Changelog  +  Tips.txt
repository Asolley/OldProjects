Added:

Kernel Burnel Quest that starts in the third town
Quest in the middle of the second dungeon
Some items
Character stuff to prepare for an actual bonus character that isn't weak like Trump or Burnel
General improvements to maps, like more NPCs and events, and more life
(The first town is still utter crap)
Added a few lines of dialogue after the current final boss to prepare for new dungeon.
Easy Mode that starts you off with extra potions, 15 gold and 5 EXP
Gameplay improvements
Amazing new title screen

Fixed:
Hairy Skull messing up the battle music
The desert having a green battle background
Less grindy now, boosted monster EXP and lowered EXP needed to level


Tips:
Reach level 2 as soon as possible, it grants +1 DEF and +1 MDF, making the early game WAY easier.
Save any Vile Bottles you find to use on a tough Dingbat encounter or a Lost Fool
Vile Bottles become weak after the first dungeon, don't be afraid to use them!
The Clock can change text box color!
Most beds allow you to heal to full / near full!
A successful auto attack grants 5 TP!
Robin's Bad Manners ability is really useful! (not on bosses though) Healing them to lower defense = value
Slemes are weak to fire!
Huffers resist slash!
Dingbats are slower than Luigi's NINJA STRIKE!
Save often, but don't lock yourself into death!
